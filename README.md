In this game, there are two players: player X (AI) and player O (you). The players alternate taking turns placing an X or O respectively in a three-by-three grid. The goal is to place three Xs or Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. If all nine squares are filled and no players have won, there is a tie. 

Each time you would like to play tic-tac-toe, run the following command:
```
$ python3.9 <relative path to main.py>
```
